* This project has been built year ago.

* This is a my own website built on wordpress. In this project I've been using gulp to compile assets. Es6, jquery, less and php+html have been used.

* Composer is used to install wordpress files and plugins.

* Theme folder location: /web/app/themes/piotrkaluza

## Development
The output files from js and scss are in the 'assets' folder.

### SCSS
Styles can be edited in src/sass folder. style.less. The structure of script files has changed since then. Now I'm trying to keep files more organised. Back then, I've been using mostly global.less for most styles.

### JS
JavaScript can be edited in src/scripts folder.

### PHP
functions.php is the main file for php script. PHP files are organized in the inc folder.
